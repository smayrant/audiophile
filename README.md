## About

This single page application was created using React for a fictional audio company called Audiophile. Assets were provided and the website was created based off of a given design and mockup through the use of Figma. Items are able to be added to cart and users can checkout after correctly filling out the checkout form. Redux was implemented for state management. Redux persist was used to persist the items added to the cart on page reload and page closure. React Router was included to handle routing and SASS was utilized for the styling.
